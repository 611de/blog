In late June 2022, Hugging Face submitted a response to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and National Science Foundation’s Request for Information on a roadmap for implementing the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) Task Force’s interim report findings. As a platform working to democratize machine learning by empowering all backgrounds to contribute to AI, we strongly support NAIRR’s efforts. 

In our response, we encourage the Task Force to:  
- Appoint Technical and Ethical Experts as Advisors
- Resource (Model and Data) Documentation Standards 
- Make ML Accessible to Interdisciplinary, Non-Technical Experts 
- Monitor for Open-Source and Open-Science for High Misuse and Malicious Use Potential
- Empower Diverse Researcher Perspectives via Accessible Tooling and Resources

Our <a href="/blog/assets/89_nairr_rfi/Hugging_Face_NAIRR_RFI_2022.pdf">memo</a> goes into further detail for each recommendation. We are eager for more resources to make AI broadly accessible in a responsible manner.
